            About Me
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            I am a 4th-year student at the National Institute of Business with a
            passion for web development and strong skills in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, React JS, Node.js, and MySQL.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            As a Full Stack Web Developer, I have hands-on experience managing
            tasks with Trello, committing code on GitLab, and building projects
            using React JS for the frontend with UI libraries like Ant Design.
            On the backend, Iâ€™ve implemented MVC architecture with Node.js,
            tested APIs using Postman, and managed databases with MySQL,
            including CRUD operations and complex table relationships.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4 text-lg sm:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-500">
            I am eager to contribute to innovative projects, grow as a
            developer, and collaborate in a dynamic team environment.
          </p>
